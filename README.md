## Simplefactory 2D

Simplefactory 2D is a factorio, satisfactory like inspired game, whit some twists and new mechanics.

It was born from my need to start learning the basics from game dev. _

## What is this?

This project is a small 2D game engine experiment using SFML.
The goal was to learn:

- Simple 2D rendering 
- Event handling
- Basic game loop architecture

## Learning Curve 

To actualy develop something playable I had to learn:

- C++ (I had previous expiriense with it)
- CMake (Just get the basic to make a proyect run)
- SFML (The "core" of my proyect)

## How to run?

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/reyjaz007/simpleFactory2d.git
cd simpleFactory2d
```
2. Install dependencies.
   - On Linux, install SDL3 via your package manager.
   - On Windows, place SDL3 headers and libraries under `external/SDL3` as expected by `CMakeLists.txt`.
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target simpleFactory2d
```
4. Run the executable:
   - Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
./simpleFactory2d
```
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
./simpleFactory2d.exe
```

## Proyect State

On development, accepting tips or suggestions, but not direct contributions. 

Tenkius for reading! :)
